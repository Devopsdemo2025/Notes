Version Control Tool
Version Control Tool is a tool which is used to keep track of projects related files and directories

2 types of version control tool
1. Distributed version control tool
2. Centralised version control tool

Difference between distributed and Centralised version control tool (GIT vs SVN or CVS)
Git is a distributed version control tool. The whole repo will be in local repo if I want to go to the previous version of a code I can get from local workspace itself.
SVN is a centralised version control tool. Only the latest version of code will be there in local workspce
If I required previous version of code then I need to checkout from central repo.

Git has many advance features like reset, fetch, stash
Incase of SVN we dont have direct commands for all these 

example for distributed version control tool is Git, bitbucket, Gitlab
example for centralised version control tool is svn and cvs

GIT :- Git is a version control tool which is used to keep track of project related files and directories.

Git Architecture :-
it consist of 3 stages 
1. Workspace  :- It is a place where we edit projects related files.
2. Stagging area :- It is an intermediate area where we save the changes 
3. Git repo or git local repo :- Here versions of files will be tracked. After executing git commit command
files will be moved to local repo 

git init :- used to create or initialize git repo 
syntx :- git init

--> set expiration to No Expiration -> select all scops -->Click on Generate Token)

Git Personal access tokens (classic) --> 


Git clone --> It is used to copy central repo or remote repo to the local workspace for the firsttime
syntax :- git clone url

git config --globle user.name "mention name"
It is used to configure the username 


git config --globle user.email "mention mailId"
It is used to configure the mailid of user

git status --> It is used to check wether the files are in workspace or staging area or local repo 
syntax :- git status

git add--> It is used to move the files from workspace to the staging area 
syntax --> git add filename --> It will move specific file to the staging area.

git add . --> It will move all the modified files to the staging area

git commit  --> It is use to move the files from staging area to the local git repo. It is used to save or commit the changes to the local repo.
syntax :- git commit -m "commit message"

git log --> It is used to check the history of the repo

branch --> Branch is used for parlell devlopment. If 2 people or 2 team will work on the same piece of code then we will create a branch and integrate the changes by merging.

git branch --> It is used to display all branches (Active branch)
syntax --> git branch
git branch -a --> It is used to display all branches (bothy Active and inactive branch)

git checkout branchname --> It is used to switch to another branch
ex :- git checkout dev

git branch branchname --> It will create a new branch from checkout branch

git checkout -b branchname --> It will create a new branch and switch to newly created branch automatically

git branch -d branchname --> It is used to delete the branch in local repo

git push origin --delete branchname --> It is used to delete the branch in central repo 

git push --> It is used to copy the changes from local repo to the central repo.
Syntax :- git push origin master  --> It will push the changes to master branch

git push origin --all --> It will push the changes from more than 1 branch of local repo to the respective branch in central repo.

git merge --> It is used to merge the changes from 1 branch to another branch
syntax :- git merge branchname
Ex:- I need to merge the changes from dev1 to main branch
	step 1 :- Make changes in dev1 branh
	step 2 :- switch to main branch --> git checkout main
	step 3 :- merge the changes from dev1 --> git merge dev1
