touch filename --> Empty file --no need of extention(.txt etc) multiple file creation 

1. How to create empty files using touch
  touch filename
  If you want to create multiple file then give space between the file names
  touch file1 file2 file3 
  
  Directory creation
  mkdir -p folder1   --> p stands for parent directory -->-p checkd folder exists or not --> if it does not exits then only
  it will create - >-p used to surpass the error message
  
  mkdir it is used to create the directory and sub directory.
  mkdir -p directoryname
  -p is used to avoid the error message. If the directory does not exits then only it will create the directory. If directory already exists then 
  -p will surpass the error message.
  
  mkdir -p folder/subfolder
  
  ls --> it is used to list all the files and directory
  ls -l --> it will list the files in long list 
  ls -lt --> recently created files dispalyed at the top(it will display based on time)
  ls -lrt --> recently created files dispalyed at the bottom
  l --> Stands for longlist
  t --> Time
  r --> reverse
  ls -a --> Display hidden files
  
  How to edit the files
  using vi editor
  Once you type the content we can use below command to save and quit the file
  press esc key :wq!  w write q quit ! force quit
  :q! --> it will quit without saving
  
  pwd --> Display the current working directory
  clear --> This is used to clear the screen
  cd --> Change Directory --> one dir to another dir or path --- It is used to change or switch the directory(path)  --> syntax --> cd directoryname
  cd .. --> Come outof 1 dir 
  cd ../.. --> come out of 2 directory
  esc :set nu --> Used to set line numbers
  esc :set nonu --> It will remove line numbers 
  esc/string --> It will search the string in a file, for next next the press n 
  esc:1,4d  --> It will delete the line from 1 to 4
  esc: 2d --> delete the 2nd line 
  cat filename --> Used to display the content of a file 
  tac filename --> it is used to dispaly the content of file in reverse order
  
  after ls -l
  start with d --> Directory
  start with -  --> file
  start with l  --> link
  
  cat > t1.txt -->terminal becomes input mode — anything you type is sent into the file t1.txt
  to come out we can press ctrl+D
  
  chmod -->change the permission for file or directory --> syntax --> chmod -R permission_value directoryname -- used to change permission for directory
  chmod permission_mod filename --> used to change permission of a file --> chmod 764 filename --> rwx for user, rw for group, r for others
  chmod  -R 651 directoryname --> rw for user , rx for group, r for others.
  
  both method can be used --> don't want to change existing permission the can go for u+w or u-x etc
  if anything 
  chmod- it is used to change the permission for a file or directory
syntax: chmod -R permission_value directoryname      used to change permission for a directory

chmod permission_value filename- used to change the permission of a file
Ex: chmod 764 filename  
764 represent rwx for user, rw for group, r for others

Ex: chmod -R 651 dirname
651 represent rw for user, rx for group, x for others

rwx    rw-   r--  
u       g     o

dev
	a b c

test
	m l


person "a" creates a file  then a is user b,c is group and m,l is other 

r-x r-- r--

r-x rw- r--


rx for user
w for group
x for others
chmod u+rx,g+w,o+x

r=4  w=2  x=1
chmod 521 file4

all for users    rw for group    r for others
chmod 764

chmod -R 764 dir1

 df --> how much memeory allocated to drive
 du --> how much memeory allocated to file or directory (filesize)
 (space given means it will consider another argument)
 
 How do you check system memory (ram memeory)
 free --> using free we can check system/RAM memory.

link :- link is a shortcut to a file 
2 types of link 1. Softlink 2. Hardlink

softlink :- It is a shortcut of a file if you make any changes in original file, it will be updated in link. If the original file is deleted then link will never work it is also called as symbolic link
syntax :- ln -s filename linkname

hardlink :- It is also a shortcut of a file. If original file is deleted then hardlink will work because it points to the inode of a file(memory address of a file)
syntax --> ln filename linkname

grep command multiple word in single pattern use --> "abc efg hij"

how do you check process running on current user ?
ps   

How do you check all the process running in a beackground ?

 find . -type f -mtime +90 | xargs rm -rf : 

check the usage of .bashrc and .bashrc_profile files( assignment)
bashrc --> Runs every time you open a new terminal window.
Used for commands you want every terminal to have — like:
Aliases (alias ll='ls -l')
Colors in prompt

.bash_profile (or .profile)
Runs only once when you log in (like SSH or console login).
Used for things that should happen only once, like:
Setting PATH
Starting background processes

umask: It is used to set the default permission for file and directory. 
Linux starts with default permissions
Files → 666 (read & write for everyone)
Directories → 777 (read, write & execute for everyone)
666-022 --> 644 rw-r--r--
666-044 --> 622 rw-r--r--
for file we can set read write for everyone. Default permission value is 666
for directory default permission value is 777
by default execute permission is not given to files for security reasons
to set the read write for user, ' r' for group and read for others the value is
rw=6 for user
r=4 for group
r=4 for others
so the value is 644. Since we are setting for the file consider 666-644=022
umask 022

how do you check which process was taking more CPU usage
ans : top


1.	create two instance call server -1 and server 2 
2  Login to server 1 and switch to root or ubuntu(both server established connection as root & root or ubuntu & ubuntu)
3 In server 1 generate ssh-keygen(press 3 times. generated keys
4) cd .ssh/  directory  and cat the public key. U will get the public keys
5) go to server 2 
6) get inside the .ssh directory
7) go to autorized_key file . copy and paste the key and save exit
8) copy the public key from server 1 and paste into sever 2 under authorized key file and seave and exit
9) go to server 1 .ssh userranme@hostname

ssh user@remote-host 'uptime' --> It is used to check from how long the remote server was up and running.

How do you check remote server was up and running(used to check connectivity of server) --> Using ping  -->(ping servername or DNS name)
Example :- ping www.google.com
(example at last it will show 1.14 ms --> time taken to  connect currentserver to remote server)

How do you login to remote server --> ssh userranme@severname

scp -> It is used to copy file or directory from 1 server to another server
syntax --> scp filename userranme@severname:path
if you wan to copy directory use -R 
example --> scp file1 ubuntu@server:/home/ubuntu
scp -r directoryname ubuntu@server:/home/ubuntu

cp is used to copy the command within the server -- 
scp used copy the command from 1 server to another server.(for scp its mandatory to do passwordless connection) 

Examples ->scp -r dir7 ubuntu@ip-172-31-5-43:/home/ubuntu/  --> copy dir from server1 to server2 from server1
scp -r ubuntu@ip-172-31-2-161:/home/ubuntu/dir1 /home/ubuntu

lsblk(list block device) --> It shows all the block stortage devices which is connected to the server.It will display disk, partitians and volumes

rsync ->It is used to copy file or directory from 1 server to another server

difference between scp and rsync
while copying data from one server to another server , If copying stopped in between  due to some network issue. Once system is back if I used scp command it start copying from beginning.
If I used rsync command it will start copying from wher it is stopped.

port number 
telnet - 23 
http - 80
https -443
DNS - 53
ssh -22
scp -22

Kill and Stop which one is preffered?
If you're trying to end a process, kill is preferred. If you're trying to pause it, kill -STOP is your tool.

#! (shebang) -->which interpreter to use to execute the script. (Bash/Shell/Python)


command line arguments in bash as shell argument. 
$0 conatin name of the file or script, 
first argument will be store in $1, 
second argument stored in $2 and so on

How do you pass arguments to the shell script through commands ?
while executing the script we will pass arguments by saparating with spaces and inside the script we will read it by $1,$2,....

$# --> It will dispaly total number of arguments pass to the script
$* --> All argument passed as string
$@ --> All argument passed in array format
$$ --> ProcessId of current running process
$! --> ProcessId of last command went into background
$? --> It is used to print the status of last executed command it dispaly 0 if the previous command is successful. Otherwise it will
dispaly non 0 value means failure of previous command.
